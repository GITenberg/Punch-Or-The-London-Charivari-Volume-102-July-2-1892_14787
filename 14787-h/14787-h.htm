    <p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;WAGNER. Vainly the Daughters of the
    River, representing the floating capital of the Banks of the
    Rhine, cry "Woa! Woa!" The orchestra, under the direction of
    Herr MAHLER, takes no notice of them, but goes on Wagnerianly,
    inexorably. Thus swimmingly we reach Walhall&mdash;where the
    fire-god <i>Loge</i> has a <i>logement</i> with very heavy
    insurance. <i>Wotan</i> and <i>Loge</i> in search of the gold.
    Then we meet the <i>Nibelungs</i> and the <i>Nibelights</i>,
    all livers under a water-cure system; and then&mdash;it's like
    a musical nightmare&mdash;<i>Alberich</i> changes himself into
    a toad and is towed off as a prisoner. <i>Fafner</i> settles
    <i>Fasolt</i> by a drum-head Court Martial, so that
    <i>Fafner</i> gets the golden honey, and <i>Fasolt</i> gets the
    whacks&mdash;and&mdash;please, Sir, I don't know any
    more&mdash;but some of the music is running river-like and
    lovely, more is puzzling, and much of it must remind Sir
    DRURIOLANUS of the rum-tum-tiddy-iddy-iddy-um-bang-whack of a
    great Drury Pantomime. House full; Duke and Duchess of
    EDINBURGH, with Princess MARIE and Crown Prince of ROUMANIA,
    enjoying themselves Wagnerially and Rou-manically.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday.&mdash;Le Prophète.</i> JOHN DE RESZKÉ not up to
    his usual form as the Sporting Prophet; but his little Brother
    EDWARD, and Messieurs MONTARIOL and CASTELMARY, first-rate as
    the three conspiring undertakers. Madame DESCHAMPS-JÉHIN, as

    <h3>THE BONES OF JOSEPH.</h3>

    <p>Dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>,&mdash;When writing to a Journal of
    light and leaders&mdash;or misleaders&mdash;last Friday, I kept
    "a little bit up my sleeve," so to speak, for the Brightest,
    Lightest, and Leadingest of all papers yclept the one, Sir,
    that bears your honoured name. After quoting from Mr.
    CHAMBERLAIN at Holloway (not <i>in</i> Holloway) on June 17,
    1885, as a gentle reminder to Mr. GOSCHEN&mdash;<i>their</i>
    "Mr. G."&mdash;I observed, "Perhaps, however, there are reasons
    why the 'Egyptian Skeleton' prefers to forget the speeches of
    Mr. CHAMBERLAIN in 1885." It struck me that, having already an
    Egyptian Skeleton, we might have as its companion a Brummagem
    Skeleton, which everyone can see through, and this sketch I beg
    to submit to you, <i>pro bono publico</i>. Always, <i>Mr.
    Punch</i>, your most obedient "subject" (artistically),</p>

    <p>Were it not that the salutation were infelicitous, we should
    have said, "Hail, all hail!" to the <i>Fête</i> at the
    Botanical Gardens, Regent's Park, last Wednesday. Besides, they
    have always an Aquarius of the name of WATERER on the premises,
    whose Rhododendrons are magnificent. So we didn't say "All
    hail!" and there was not a single drop, of rain, or in the
    attendance, to damage a charming show which has so often been
    spoilt by the drop too much that has floored many a <i>Fête</i>
    of Flora. Nothing could have been prettier. Flowers of speech
    are inadequate to describe the scene. "Simply lovely!" is the
    best epitome of praise.</p>

    <h2>LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.</h2>

    <p class="author"><i>The Look-out, Sheepsdoor, Kent</i>.</p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>Ascot has been too much for me! What with the excitement of
    racing all day, and bézique half the night&mdash;(another sign
    of the times; women no longer "play for love," but "love to
    play!")&mdash;to say nothing of the constant strain on one's
    nerves as to what the weather was going to do to one's gowns, I
    have had a severe attack of overwork, with complicating
    symptoms of my old enemy, idleness!&mdash;so that, on my return
    to town, my Doctor&mdash;(he's a <i>dear</i> man, and
    prescribes just what I suggest)&mdash;insisted that I should at
    once run down to the Seaside to recuperate. Hence my retirement
    to the little fishing village of Sheepsdoor in Kent, "far from
    the gadding crowd;" a most delightfully rural and little-known
    resort, where we all go about in brown
    canvas-shoes&mdash;(russia-leather undreamt of!)&mdash;and wear
    out all our old things, utterly regardless of whether we look
    "<i>en suite</i>" or not. The only precaution <i>I</i> take is
    to carry in my pocket a thick veil, which I pop on if I see
    anybody with evidences of "style" about them coming my way;
    fortunately, this has only happened once, when I met a certain
    well-known "Merry Duchess" and her charming little daughter,
    who both failed to penetrate my disguise!</p>

    <p>I am sorry that my selected horse for the Windsor June
    Handicap did not run&mdash;though the word of command was
    given, "<i>Macready</i>!"&mdash;he was not told to be
    "present!"&mdash;being presumably short of a gallop or two, and
    therefore lacking "fire!" This little series of jokes is
    proudly dedicated to the <i>Military</i>, and <i>Civilians</i>
    are "warned off!"&mdash;which is another turf expression. The
    much-needed rain has come at last, and the Heath should be in
    fine condition, which was more than its namesake at Ascot was,
    and all for want of a little attention&mdash;I am told that the
    far end was all in lumps, which caused the "<i>Lover</i>" to
    come down in his race&mdash;though that was hardly a surprise,
    as we know that "the course of true love never <i>did</i> run
    smooth!"</p>

    <p>Now&mdash;dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>, if you want a few hours'
    fresh air, command the special train, which I am told, is kept
    in readiness for you at every London Terminus, to transport
    you&mdash;(not for your <i>country's</i> good, but <i>your
    own</i>)&mdash;to Sheepsdoor, Kent, where you shall receive a
    hearty welcome&mdash;Lord ARTHUR is not with me, but my French
    maid will <i>chaperon</i> us&mdash;<i>if necessary</i>.</p>

    <p class="author">Yours devotedly,<br />
    LADY GAY.</p>

    <p>"Cave Kanem!"&mdash;"If," Dr. KANE is reported to have said
    at the Ulster Appeal Meeting in St. James's Hall, last
    Wednesday, "If they (the Ulster Irishmen) had to choose between
    arbitrary oppression and an appeal for justice to the God of
    battles, he (Dr. KANE) had no more doubt than he had about his
    existence, that that appeal would be made, and that God would
    defend the right." With the saving clause adroitly introduced
    into the last sentence, everyone, except an Atheist, will
    agree; and, but for this, this speech reads as an incentive to
    Civil War, intended to stir up brother against brother to fight
    to the death. Such sentiments may, in the future, be remembered
    as marked with "the brand of KANE."</p>

    <p>A Difficulty.&mdash;<i>Mr. Dick</i> was unable to keep,
    "King Charles the First's head" out of his literary work. So
    Our OSCAR, it is said, has been unable to keep the head of St.
    John the Baptist out of his play, <i>Salomé</i>, accepted by
    SARAH. Hence difficulty with licenser. The real truth, we
    believe, is that the head, according to received tradition,
    should be brought in by <i>Salomé</i> "on a charger," and SARAH
    protests against this, as she is not an equestrian.</p>

    <p>A New Songstress.&mdash;Mr. CUSINS, on Wednesday last,
    accompanying SCHUMANN, RUBINSTEIN, &amp; Co., may fairly be
    described as "CUSINS German." A very successful Concert,
    musically notable, among many notable things, for the
    <i>début</i> of Miss GWLADYS WOOD, who, being vociferously
    encored, gave a Tyrolean Volkslied, or "VOKES' Family" dance
    and song, playing the accompaniment herself. "She ought to do
    well."&mdash;I quote SHAKESPEARE, WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, the
    Musician, who sang a <i>duo</i> with Mme. VALDA. The Concert
    commenced with a "Septette (By DESIRE)." This is a new
    Composer.</p>

    REED is immensely funny, especially when disguised as a Charity
    Girl. On no account miss the Grain of Chaff's capital French

    <h2>THE HORSE-EDUCATOR.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Sketch at Sydenham.</i>)</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>An Arena at North End of Crystal
        Palace.&mdash;The Arena is thickly covered with sawdust,
        and occupied solely by a light American waggon. There is a
        small steam-engine at one side, with an escape-pipe and
        valve projecting into the Circus, and a bundle of
        parti-coloured stuff is fluttering overhead opposite. From
        loose-boxes, three or four horses are examining these
        ominous preparations with apprehensive eyes. Enter a Portly
        Gentleman in a tall hat and frock-coat, who bows to the
        audience, and is but faintly applauded, owing to a
        disappointed sense that the ideal Horse-trainer would not
        tame in a tall hat. However, he merely appears to
        introduce</i> Professor NORTON B. SMITH, <i>who, turning
        out to be a slender, tall man, in a slouch hat, black
        velveteen coat, breeches, and riding boots, is received
        with enthusiasm.</i></p>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>The Professor</i> (<i>with a slight Transatlantic
        accent</i>). The first animal On my list, Ladies and

        Fireworks, Music, Paper. Almost <i>anything</i>, in fact.
        Bring out Number One, boys. (<i>To a tall Groom and a short
        one, who rush to the loose-boxes, the short Groom falling

        afraid of almost anything is brought in, and begins to
        plunge at once, as though defying any</i> Professor <i>to
        cure</i> him.) Now, this animal is not Vicious, he's only
        Nervous.</p>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Paterfamilias, in audience</i> (<i>who has a spoilt
        horse at home</i>). Just what I always say about
        <i>Tartar</i>&mdash;it's nerves, not vice.</p>

        <p><i>His Eldest Daughter.</i> Shall you send him here to
        be cured, Father?</p>

        <p><i>Paterf.</i> No, my dear; quite unnecessary. When I
        see how it's done, I shall able to take <i>Tartar</i> in
        hand myself, I have no doubt.</p>

        <p><i>The Prof.</i> (<i>instructively</i>). It is natural
        For a Horse when frightened at anything in Front of him, To
        jump Backwards, and when frightened at anything Back of
        him, To jump Forwards. (<i>Applause, in recognition of the
        accuracy and observation of this axiom.</i>) Now I will
        show you my method Of correcting this Tendency by means Of
        my double Safety Rope and driving Rein, without Cruelty.
        Always Be Humane, Never causing any Pain if you Possibly
        can Help it. Fetch that Harness. (<i>The short Groom trips
        again, but so elaborately as to be immediately recognised
        as the funny man of the performance, after which his
        awkwardness ceases to entertain. The</i> Professor
        <i>shouts</i>, <i>"Woa!" and, as the horse declines to
        accept this suggestion, emphasises it by pulling the double
        rope, which, being attached to the animals forelegs,
        promptly brings him on his knees, much to his surprise and
        indignation</i>.) Never use the word "Woa!" Only when you
        mean your horse To stop. Woa! (<i>horse down again,
        intensely humiliated</i>.) If you mean him just To go
        quiet, say "Steady!" and teach him The difference Of the
        words. Never afterwards Deceiving him. (Paterf. <i>makes a
        note of this on Tartar's account.</i>) Steady ... Woa!
        (<i>Same business repeated; horse evidently feeling that he
        is the victim of a practical joke, and depressed.
        Finally</i>, Professor <i>says</i> <i>"Woa!" without
        pulling, and horse thinks it better to take the
        hint.</i>)</p>

        <p><i>Paterf.</i> Wonder where I could get that
        apparatus&mdash;just the thing for <i>Tartar</i>!</p>

        <p><i>His Daughter</i>. But you would have to lay down such
        a lot of sawdust first. And it might teach him to kneel
        down whenever you said "Woa!" you know, and <i>that</i>
        wouldn't do!</p>

        <p><i>Paterf.</i> Um! No. Never thought of that.</p>

        <p><i>Prof.</i> I will now introduce To his notice the Bass
        Drum. (<i>The two Grooms dance about the horse, banging a
        drum and clashing cymbals, at which he shies consumedly.
        Gradually he appears to realise that his lines have fallen
        among lunatics, and that his wisest policy is to humour
        them. He does so, even to the extent of suffering the big
        drum to be beaten on his head with patient
        disgust.</i>)</p>

        <p><i>The Daughter</i>. You might try <i>that</i> with
        <i>Tartar</i>, Father. You could have the dinner-gong, you
        know.</p>

        <p><i>Paterf.</i> (<i>dubiously</i>). H'm, I'm not at all
        sure that it would have the same effect, my dear.</p>

        <p><i>Prof.</i> (<i>who has vaulted on the horse's
        back</i>). I will now make him familiar With an umbrella.
        (<i>Opens it suddenly; horse plunges</i>.) Now, Sir, this
        is nothing but an umbrella&mdash;vurry good one
        too&mdash;it isn't going to hurt you; look at it!</p>

        <p>[<i>He waves it round the animal's head, and finally
        claps it over his eyes, the horse inspects it, and tacitly
        admits that he may have been prejudiced.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Daughter.</i> It would be quite easy to do that,

        <p><i>Prof.</i> (<i>introducing another horse</i>). This
        animal is a confirmed Kicker. We'll give him a little
        tinware, just to amuse him. (<i>Some tin pans and bells are
        attached to the animal's tail, but, perceiving that kicks
        are expected from him, his natural contrariness makes him
        decline to make sport for Philistines in this manner.</i>)
        Hang on more tinware, boys! Some persons here may feel
        Disappointed that he Doesn't kick. Remember&mdash;that is
        not My Fault. They can't be too vicious to please me.
        (<i>The Horse sees his way to score, and after bearing
        various trials in a spirit of Christian resignation, leaves
        the Arena, consoled by the reflection that no one there got
        much fun out of</i> him, <i>at all events. A Jibber is
        brought in; the</i> Professor <i>illustrates his patent
        method of teaching him to stand while being groomed, by
        tying a rope to his tail, seizing the halter in one hand
        and the rope in the other, and obliging the horse to
        perform an involuntary waltz, after which he mounts him and
        continues his discourse.</i>) Now it occasionally happens
        To some riders that when they want To go down G. Street,
        their horse has a sort of idea he'd like to go up E.
        Street, and he generally <i>does</i> go up it too!</p>

        <p><i>A Sister</i> (<i>to her Brother</i>). ROBERT that's

        <p>[ROBERT <i>doesn't answer, fervently hoping that his

        comment.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>The Prof.</i> Well, the way to overcome that is just
        to turn the animal round&mdash;so&mdash;several times till
        he gets dizzy and forgets where E. Street is, and then he
        says to himself, "I guess I'd better go wherever the
        gentleman wants!"</p>

        <p><i>The Sister.</i> ROBERT's horse turned round and round
        like that&mdash;<i>didn't</i> he, ROBERT? [ROBERT <i>turns
        rather red and grunts.</i></p>

        <p><i>Her Pretty Friend.</i> And then did he go where your

        <p><i>The Sister.</i> Oh yes, at last. (ROBERT <i>breathes
        more freely.</i>) Only without ROBERT. [ROBERT <i>wonders

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, June 20</i>.&mdash;Black Rod
    got up little joke to-night by way of relieving the weight of
    these mournful parting moments. As soon as House met, word went
    round that, in absence of Mr. G., and other Leaders of the
    Opposition, SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE intended to take Prince
    ARTHUR in hand, and insist on his making clean breast of date
    of Dissolution. A Royal Commission arranged in other House.
    Black Rod despatched to summon Commons to assist at ceremony.
    "The SAGE wants the House of Lords abolished, does he?" said
    Black Rod, to his friend the White Elephant. "Very well; but
    before it's done, I'll bet you 100 to 1, as JOHN MORLEY says,
    that I, as representative of the Lords, will make him shut up,
    and pretty sharp too. He little knows there's a Rod in pickle
    for him, and a Black 'un, too."</p>

    <p>Everything worked out as it was planned. On Motion for Third
    Reading of Appropriation Bill, SAGE, in his most winning way,
    invited Prince ARTHUR to name the happy day. Black Rod, getting
    tip, hurried across Lobby; reached the door just as SAGE was in
    middle of a sentence. "Black Rod!" roared Doorkeeper, at top of
    his voice. SAGE paused, looked with troubled glance towards
    door, stood for a moment as if he would resist the incursion,
    and catching sight of sword by Black Rod's side, abruptly sat
    down amid general titter.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Still winding-up business. GEORGE CURZON explained Indian
    Budget to PLOWDEN, and Rev. SAM SMITH, who thought it very
    good. So it was, comprehensive, lucid, here and there
    brightened with felicitous touches of eloquence.</p>

    <p>"Pity," said GRAND CROSS, when I mentioned to him the
    depressing circumstances attendant upon delivery of speech;
    "CURZON's a clever youth. When he's been with me a month or
    two, he'll brighten up considerably. Great advantage for a
    young man to have such guidance, coming into almost daily
    contact with a person like his present Chief. The fact is,
    TOBY, I am really responsible for the state of the House
    to-night. The country, England and India alike, are so
    satisfied with my rule over what I may, perhaps without
    offence, call our dusky Empire, that people do not think it
    worth while to go down to House to hear the affair discoursed
    on by my Under-Secretary. Amongst the natives in India, I'm
    told, I'm regarded as a sort of Fetish. Travellers in remote
    regions bring home stories of finding, set up in humble
    cottages, little images, more or less resembling me. GORST told
    me they have a saying there, which he was good enough to
    translate. His knowledge of Hindustanee is extensive, peculiar,
    and acquired with remarkable rapidity. These are the lines:</p>

    <div class="poem">

            <p>Put your money on GRAND CROSS.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>A free translation, GORST says, but gives you the swing and
    the spirit of the distich. Rather hard on CURZON that my
    popularity should spoil his speech, but a good thing for the
    country."</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Budget brought in.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Wonderfully good muster in Lords
    to-night. Every man upon his mettle. As the MARKISS says, with
    that epigrammatic style that makes him so delightful, "The
    first duty of a Peer is to appear." Those Radicals been
    protesting that talk about necessity for prolonging Session
    over week all a flam. Simply meant to make it impossible for
    our delicate friend, the British Workman, to get to poll. Peers
    must show they mean business, by turning up with regularity and
    despatch.</p>

    <p>Appeal to patriotic feelings nobly answered; nearly a
    hundred Lords in place to-night. CHELMSFORD, walking down with
    his umbrella, just about to add a unit to the number; stopped
    on the threshold by strange sight; looking in from room beyond
    the Throne, sees DENMAN standing at Table, shaking his fist at
    Prime Minister. DENMAN is wearing what CHELMSFORD, who is
    short-sighted, at first took to be red Cap of Liberty. But it's
    nothing more dangerous than a red skull-cap, designed to resist
    draughts. Needn't be red, but it is. Business before House,
    Third Reading of Small Holdings Bill Occurs to DENMAN to move
    its rejection; talks for ten minutes; difficulty to catch his
    remarks; understood from fragmentary phrases to be extolling
    someone as a luminous Statesman; seeing measure before the
    House is Small Holdings Bill, noble Lords naturally conclude
    he's talking about CHAPLIN. MARKISS interposes; says, "Noble
    Lord not speaking to Bill before House."</p>

    <p>It was at this moment CHELMSFORD arrived. Saw DENMAN draw
    himself up to full height, shake his fist at the MARKISS, and
    this time at full pitch of quivering voice cry, "Ha! ha! you
    wish to <i>clôture</i> me again, do you? I'm very much obleeged
    to you. I have a right to refer in a hereditary assembly to the
    best man that ever stood in it."</p>

    <p>Then noble Lords knew it couldn't have been CHAPLIN. Not
    yet.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Still winding it up.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday, June 28</i>.&mdash;Parliament prorogued and
    dissolved. "All over at last," says ROSCOE, putting it in
    another and more original way. Few to part where (six years
    ago) many met. Still some, chiefly Metropolitan Members, remain
    to see the last of the old Parliament.</p>

    <p>"Good-bye, TOBY," Prince ARTHUR says, after we've shaken
    hands with the SPEAKER. "Shall see you again in August.
    <i>You</i>'re all right. One of those happy fellows who are
    returned unopposed. As for me, I have to fight for my seat, and
    my life."</p>

    <p>"You'll come back too," I said; "but you'll be sitting on
    the other side of House. What'll you do when you're in
    Opposition?"</p>

    <p>"I'll go to the Opera every Wednesday night," said Prince
    ARTHUR, with a gleam of joy lighting up his face.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Parliament dissolved.</p>

    to <i>Mr. Punch</i> the following news about his distinguished
    patient. "Tell the B.P. that P.B. sleeps like a top. This is no
    hum. He is up at 7 A.M., and wishes everyone 'the top of the
    mornin' to you,' puts on his top-boots and top-hat, and then
    goes out for a spin."</p>

    <p>FROM A CORRESPONDENT ANENT THE TRUSTEES, MESSRS. COHEN AND
    LEVY, AND THE GIFT OF £350,000 FOR LIVERPOOL AND
    MANCHESTER.&mdash;Sir,&mdash;It has been asked, what will they
    do with it? Liverpool and Manchester are both millionnaires and
    millowners too. Why not send a little to <i>me</i>? Who's
    Cohen, I mean who's goin' to Leave-y <i>me</i> anything? No
    spare Cohen&mdash;or Coin&mdash;ever comes <i>my</i> way! Would
    that a Co-hen would lay for me a golden egg as valuable as the
    Kohenore! Sir, I am of Irish extraction, and the Irish are of
    Hebraic origin, so I have some claim. Why? Because Irishmen are
    Hebrews first and Irish afterwards. The first settlers on
    settling-day in Ireland were Hebrews to a man, and isn't it
    clear that "Liffey" was originally "Levy?"</p>

    <p>TIP FROM OUR OWN BOOKING-OFFICE.&mdash;Persons about to go
    to the Country, whether to defend their own seat or attack
    someone else's, can't do better, my Baronite says, than take
    with them P.W. CLAYDEN's <i>England Under Coalition</i>, just
    published by FISHER UNWIN. It's not much to carry, but it's
    worth the trouble of packing up; also of unpacking, and
    reading. It tells the story of two Parliaments and three
    Governments. A pretty story it is, more interesting than most
    novels, and in one volume too. A marvel of condensation and
    lucid narrative. Only one thing lacking to a work likely to be
    constantly used for reference, and that is an index. "But you
    can't have everything," as <i>Queen Eleanor</i> said to <i>Fair
    Rosamond</i> when, having swallowed the contents of the
    poisoned chalice, she asked for a dagger.</p>

    <h2>ELECTION NOTES.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Special Commissioner.</i>)</h4>

    <p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;I am glad you consented eventually to the
    terms I proposed. After all, £100 a-week (<i>and expenses</i>)
    is a mere trifle for the arduous work I expect to do for you.
    According to your instructions, I arrived three nights ago in
    the ancient borough of Bunkham-on-the-Marsh, and at once took
    steps to pursue those inquiries which are necessary for a
    satisfactory estimate of the political situation. My experience
    as a lightning change <i>artiste</i> is quite invaluable. I
    visit the Liberal Committee-rooms, and attend Liberal meetings
    in a complete suit of corduroys and horny hands. Five minutes
    afterwards I find myself in a military moustache, a frock coat,
    and patent leather boots at the Conservative head-quarters. In
    the former disguise I enthusiastically advocate the Newcastle
    Programme, and denounce the base minions of Coercion. In the
    latter I rouse Conservative partisans to frenzy by my
    impassioned appeals on behalf of one Queen, one Flag, one
    Empire, and a policy of enlightened Conservative progress. I
    can highly recommend my two perorations, in one of which I
    consign Mr. GLADSTONE to eternal infamy, while in the other I
    hold up Lord SALISBURY to the derision of mankind.</p>

    <p>I send you herewith extracts from the two newspapers
    published in Bunkham. The <i>Bunkham News</i> is the organ of
    the Liberals; the <i>Bunkham Standard</i> (with which are
    incorporated the <i>Bunkham Messenger</i> and the <i>Bunkham
    Guardian and Mangelhire Express</i>) expresses the views of the
    Conservatives in this important district.</p>

                valign="top">At last! The period of subterfuges and
                evasions is past. Fraud and dishonesty have had
                their day, Coercion has done its worst, and the
                time has come when the most scandalous and
                disgraceful Government of which history bears
                record, will have to submit itself for judgment to
                the opinions of those who are dishonoured by being
                its fellow-countrymen. We can have no doubt
                whatever as to what the result of the contest will
                be in this enlightened constituency. The men of
                Bunkham have been at all times noted for their love
                of freedom and justice, and for their hatred of
                those who base themselves upon oppression and
                iniquity. The Liberal Candidate, Mr. HENRY PLEDGER,
                has now been before the Constituency for more than
                a year. Wherever he has gone he has been received
                with unparalleled demonstrations of enthusiasm by
                the immense majority of our fellow-townsmen. His
                eloquence, combined with his engaging manners, have
                won all hearts. The fight will be short, but
                severe. Men of Bunkham, will you lag in the rear?
                The issue is to those who work from now to the
                polling day. If you only make a united effort,
                triumph is assured.</td>

            <td align="left"
                valign="top">The date of the Dissolution has been
                fixed, and by making it impossible for the
                Elections to be held on a Saturday, the Government
                have given one more proof of their deep and sincere
                devotion to the highest interests of the
                working-classes. There never has been any Ministry,
                we make bold to say, whose record will better bear
                the fierce light of public investigation.
                Grievances have been redressed, moderate reforms,
                such as the country desired, have been passed into
                law, and turbulence and outrage have been
                repressed. No body of men ever deserved more fully
                what they now possess, and are sure to
                retain&mdash;the confidence and gratitude of their
                fellow-citizens. Our Member, Mr. TUFFAN, has borne
                a not unimportant part in assisting the Government
                by his presence in the House of Commons. His manly,
                straightforward integrity, and his universal
                generosity, have endeared him to all classes in
                Bunkham. We look forward with absolute confidence
                to his return by an immense majority. From the
                disorganised ranks of our adversaries there is
                little to fear. Let us stand shoulder to shoulder,
                and leave no stone unturned to win a victory which
                is even now within our grasp.</td>

    <p>I have had interviews with prominent politicians on both
    sides, and have been assured on both sides, that victory is
    certain. Both Candidates are constantly occupied in driving all
    over the borough in pair-horse carriages, lavishly decorated
    with the party colours, orange for the Liberals, blue for the
    Conservatives. Mrs. PLEDGER is magnificent in an orange silk
    dress; Mrs. TUFFAN overwhelms me with blue ribbons. Master
    PLEDGER waves an orange banner in every street; Miss TUFFAN
    distributes blue cards in all the shops. The Liberal
    Committee-rooms are ablaze with pictures of Mr. GLADSTONE; the
    Conservative Office flames with Union Jacks, and other Imperial
    devices. Eight meetings are to be held in different parts of
    the Constituency to-night. Immense efforts are being made to
    capture the votes of the Association of Jam Dealers, which has
    its chief factory here. Master PLEDGER has just gone by in a
    Victoria, with a huge pot of "Bunkham Jam" on the seat in front
    of him. He had a spoon, and was apparently enjoying himself.
    This manoeuvre has much depressed the Conservatives, who
    consider it disgraceful. More next week.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
